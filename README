dist_lda

Lightweight python implementation of a distributed, collapsed gibbs sampler for LDA. Uses redis to coordinate multiple nodes.


dist_lda uses a dirty transaction model where words might be missing from local counts and totals in order to improve performance at the expense of further approximating the markov chain.
